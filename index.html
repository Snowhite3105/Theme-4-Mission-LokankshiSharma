            <h4> Soil is a mixture of organic matter, gases, minerals, liquids, and organisms that together support life such as plants, flowers and a home to insects .</h4>
            <h3> How is it formed?</h3>
            <br>
            <p> Soil is formed due to weathering of rocks.Large rocks break into smaller pieces due to rain, wind and temperature.Formation of soil is a slow process. It takes many years to form 1 inch of topsoil on the surface, scientists believe that it takes around millions of years. </p>
            <br>
            <h3> What else makes Soil?</h3>
            <br>
            <p> Apart from rocks and minerals there are other natural elements that are used to make the soil are:
                â€¢ Water â€“ Due to rain, water is held between the grains inside the pores.
                â€¢ Air - Pores and cracks in the soil helps to provide air in it.
                â€¢ Nutrients â€“ Wastes of living things and organic matter.
                â€¢ Microorganisms â€“ Organisms that lives on soil, decompose the dead plants and animals into soil</p>

            <h4> A rock is any naturally occurring solid mass or aggregate of minerals or mineraloid matter. </h4>

            <br>
            <h3> How is it formed?</h3>
            <br>
            <p> Rocks are composed primarily of grains of minerals, which are crystalline solids formed from atoms chemical bonded into an orderly structure. Some rocks also contain mineraloids, which are rigid, mineral-like substances, such as volcanic glass, that lacks crystalline structure.</p>

        <h3 class="text-left"> Pollution is the introduction of contaminants into the natural environment that cause adverse change. Pollution can take the form of chemical substances or energy, such as noise, heat, or light.  </h3>
        <br>
        <h3 text-left> Pollution can be divided into 3 categories: Air Pollution, Land Pollution & Noise Pollution </h3>
          <br>
          <h2> How can we stop it?</h2>
          <br> 
<h3 class="text-left"> 1. Use the 3R's- Reuse your waste, Reduce your waste & Recycle your waste. </h3>
<h3 class="text-left"> 2. Use Public transport or Carpool to avoid causing a lot of pollution. </h3>
<h3 class="text-left"> 3. Avoid wasting electricity and water. </h3>
<h3 class="text-left"> 4. Use fans instead of Air Conditioners</h3>
